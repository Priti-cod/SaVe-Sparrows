    <h2><b><em> House Sparrow</em></b></h2>

    <p>
        Birds, our chirpy feathered friends, who have amazed us by their aerodynamics and exotic colors, are under great
        threat. <br>
        There are 9,934 species of birds that are existing in the world today, out of which, a staggering 1,313(13%)
        <br>
        are threatened under existction. <b>House Sparrow</b> is one of them. <br>
        <b>Sparrows</b>, though tiny, are very sensitive and strongly immune birds, and their sudden disappearance as
        sentinels or as <br>
        ecological indicators is a warning to humans about impending environmental hazards.

    <h2><b>Reasons for the dislocation of Sparrows</b></h2>

    <h3><em>Non-availability of tiny insects as food due to the loss of vegetation <br></em></h3>
    <h3><em>The excessive use of mosquito repellents <br></em></h3>
    <h3><em>Concrete architectures with no nesting sites for sparrows <br></em></h3>
    <h3><em>Air-conditioning which leaves no entry or exit points for feeding sparrows <br></em></h3>
    <h3><em>nestlings. <br></em></h3>
